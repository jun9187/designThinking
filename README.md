### Q&A from presentation
Q: How do this application enhance social activities between juniors and seniors?

A: Solubillion is mainly focused on academic purpose so it isn't planned to let users have many social interactions like other social media app.

Q: How to ensure privacy in the student bounties app?

A: In solubillion, it is optional for users to register their personal info such as name, matric number and others. So it doesn't have privacy issues related to leakage of personal informations since users can choose to be anonymous when using our app.

Q: How do you generate an income for the app maintainance?

A: We mostly generate our income through ads and taxes from users using the bounty system.

## Reflection
I learnt various skills while doing design thinking project such as teamworking and communication skill since this project requires us to communicate with group members to discuss about idea and proceed our works. Other than that, I also learnt how to edit a video using Adobe Premiere when doing the report video of this project. The improvement for this project I would like to suggest is the duration should be longer, if the duration is longer, we will be able to create a more functional prototype to present our idea.
